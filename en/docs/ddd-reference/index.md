## Definitions

#### **domain**

A sphere of knowledge, influence, or activity. The subject area to which the user applies a program is the domain of the software.

#### **model**

A system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a domain and can be used to solve problems related to that domain.

#### **ubiquitous language**

A language structured around the domain model and used by all team members within a bounded context to connect all the activities of the team with the software.

#### **context**

The setting in which a word or statement appears that determines its meaning. Statements about a model can only be understood in a context.

#### **bounded context**

A description of a boundary (typically a subsystem, or the work of a particular team) within which a particular model is defined and applicable.
